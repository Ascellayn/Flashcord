These are the "Decompiled" files of Flashcord Beta bSTB-230811
The Stable Branch of Flashcord is always late compared to the SID branch.
This is a modified Stable Branch with features removed to meet the Replugged's Store rules.
If the missing features are an annoyance consider downloading a Flashcord Module that restores said features.
