'''
Notice: I'm dog shit at Python. No seriously.
This script compiles every single CSS File in the input_files array to produce a singular file to be uploaded at
https://sirio-network.com/flashcord/sid.css (or lpm.css or stb.css)
I honestly have no idea how this script works and it's half assed (?).
Ever since Flashcord versions "compiled" past or during January 2024, every single file except lpm.css (due to Replugged restrictions)
are minimized manually and are inserted manually at the beginning the following string:

/* WARNING: The file you have opened is not meant to be edited and isn't user friendly.
