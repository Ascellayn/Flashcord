- Added Flashcord Telemetry System (SID ONLY FOR NOW)
- Fixed not being able to see who's in a voice chat while the chat slide is active.
- Moved the pop menu padding fix to the pop menu module
- Fixed bug where clicking on Menthrepin would always fade the whole pop up out, causing user irritation when attempting to select something.
