This is the latest version of Flashcord being worked on, as I'm leaving to take a major break, this version is available.
Not much has really changed since the last SID build but there may be changes that you want to get still.
Please note that FTS is included in this build, remove it yourself if you want, I won't bother.
This is why this build isn't replacing the current SID build.
