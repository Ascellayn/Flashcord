update: holy shit they're actually doing it, I'm busy but later today I should be able to get a Ceres build out

# everybody panic discord started rolling out the desktop visual refresh
Flashcord Ceres (the complete rewrite of Flashcord Beta for DVR), is currently ***REALLY not ready*** for everyone yet. It will be released publicly soon but please note **__A LOT of features from Beta will be missing!!__**.

### If you aren't aware what DVR is, it basically is the nuclear bomb for every single discord theme
Discord is releasing soon a overhaul to the Discord client which breaks most if not all Discord themes. we're all gonna die :(

‚ö†Ô∏è The following images of Flashcord are outdated (as they are from Flashcord Beta), new images of Flashcord Ceres will be shown soon.

# üì∏ This. This is Flashcord Beta.
## The world's most complex Discord Theme.

# üìë Getting Started: Check the Flashcord Wiki
### That's right this theme has a bloody arch wiki manual page knock-off. Get ready to RTFM.
Due to the complexity of Flashcord, yes, I am not kidding. This Discord Theme has a wiki page. **And trust me, you seriously need it.**
