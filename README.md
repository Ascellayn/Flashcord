### NOTICE
The Channel Emojis Discord Experiment that Flashcord semi-depends on has been recently sent to the shadow realm, a fix for this absolutely chaotic change will be implemented in the next major update this April.
**UPDATE: The next major update will release on the 23rd of April. Expect things to break as this update is ABSOLUTELY MASSIVE.**

# üì∏ This. This is Flashcord Beta.
## The world's most complex Discord Theme.
## It's all about the chat space.

## But also for the eye candy.

## The ridiculously insane [customization](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Variables#%EF%B8%8F-custom-background-mode) and [integration](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Flashcord-Modules).

# üìë Getting Started: Check the Flashcord Wiki
### That's right this theme has a bloody arch wiki manual page knock-off. Get ready to RTFM.
Due to the complexity of Flashcord, yes, I am not kidding. This Discord Theme has a wiki page. **And trust me, you seriously need it.**

## [Instructions about anything and everything on Flashcord is available here (including install instructions depending on your client mod).](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki)

Flashcord is currently in Beta, expect lots of things to change and quickly! Next major version will be Flashcord Gamma, set to release in 2024 if everything goes according to plan. By 2025, Flashcord should hopefully be done.

### Is ~~Crysis~~ Flashcord too much for your computer?
Check out Flashcord's LPM Branch, aka [Flashcord for Low-End Systems](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Flashcord-LPM), an extremely debloated version that only keeps the essential features and primordial QoL changes.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è The next major SID update will break ***__EVERYTHING__*** customisation related.
A vote has been casted and approved by the community, by the next major Flashcord update set to release on April, every single variable name will change to be way more consistence and way less confusing. Naturally this will break every single configuration made by users. A python script will be provided to convert the old variables to the new ones.

Flashcord works on every major client mods (Replugged, Vencord, BetterDiscord), however keep in mind that Flashcord was optimized, is fully featured, built and made on Replugged specifically, missing features and minors bugs present on other clients will be fixed/added in the future.
