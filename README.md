# üéâ Flashcord Chat Effects
### Flashcord Chat Effects have moved to the [Flashcord Wiki](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Chat-Effects).
If these effects cause way too much lag, **consider disabling them using the variable "--Enable-ChatEffects"**. (Flashcord Alpha)

## üíâ Plugin Support

Flashcord supports many pretty cool Replugged Plugins, all of which are required if you want the best experience. To see compatible plugins, simply check the plugins tab (REPLUGGED ONLY)

Some required plugins are shown in the [Flashcord WIki](https://github.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/wiki/Installing-Flashcord-on-Replugged#-required-plugins).

#### For Flashcord Stable Users: Ignore the message about not getting the full experience because plugins are missing. That message will be gone soon, the real plugins you really need are shown in the wiki.
