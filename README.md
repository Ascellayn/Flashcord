# ‚¨áÔ∏è Installing Flashcord
Before we can start, decide which version of Flashcord you would like to install, the Stable version gets updates every week or more while the "SID" versions gets updated daily. SID can be unstable at times so if you want a theme that just works then install Stable.
## ü¶∫ Installing Stable:
[For Replugged Users, simply click here](https://replugged.dev/install?identifier=SiriusBYT/flashcord&source=github), this will open a page that will communicate with your client to install Flashcord.
### You can install Flashcord Stable on other clients such as BetterDiscord or Vencord by adding this to your QuickCSS, please note that Flashcord doesn't fully support other clients!
‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot decide if you wanna update or not with this method, it updates as soon as your client fetches for Flashcord's code.
```
@import url("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/main/src/main.css");
```
## üî• Installing SID:
‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot decide if you wanna update or not with Flashcord SID, it updates as soon as your client fetches for Flashcord's code.
To switch to Flashcord SID, please **Paste the Following Line** into your **Quick CSS** and then click on **"Apply Changes"**
```
@import url("https://sirio-network.com/flashcord/fc-sndl.css");
```
To force update Flashcord SID, open the **DevTools** (CTRL + SHIFT + I), head over to the **Network** Tab, then check **"Disable Cache"** and click on **"Apply Changes"**.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Make sure to also not have Flashcord Stable still enabled after switching to SID to prevent code conflicts.

## üîÑÔ∏è Flashcord Version Status
ü¶∫ Flashcord Stable: [aSTB-230714_HF1] | **7 Feature Updates Behind SID.** | üåê Root Code Base: aSID-230714-HF1

üî• Flashcord SID: [aSID-230721-HF1] | **0 Days without an Emergency Hotfix Update.**


# üí° Configuring Flashcord
## ‚ö†Ô∏è Flashcord requires the "Channel Emojis" Discord Experiment for the best experience.
Refer to your client's way of enabling Experiments, then search for **"Channel Emojis"** and set the **Treatment to 2**

## üõë NOTICE ABOUT CUSTOM IMAGE BACKGROUNDS: Requires ["LegalDiscordBypasses" by @loneweeb.tsx](https://replugged.dev/install?identifier=dev.tharki.LegalDiscordBypasses) or Discord Nitro
Due to the complexity of Flashcord, it is better to seperate the Custom Background Image Theme into another one, problem is that the only other "it just works" theme is a Discord Nitro theme. 
Using the plugin  is thus necessary if you wanna use said feature without Nitro.
![](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SiriusBYT/flashcord/main/FC-PREVIEW/DiscordCanary_6RUcvA0asO.png)
Choosing any of those themes will activate the Custom IMG mode. It is recommended to use a dark themed one for visibility reasons. (‚ÑπÔ∏è In aSID-230720+, you no longer have to pick a random theme)
