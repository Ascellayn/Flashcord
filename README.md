# Invite Access now Available to all Members of the [SGN Discord Server](https://discord.gg/z93kHwGuZt)!
Just ask nicely and I may give you access to it :p

## If everything goes according to plan, the first public alpha of Flashcord will be available sometime in early July.
Flashcord is the self proclaimed "most advanced Discord Theme" to date.

Latest version is currently "aSID-230701" which is not available here for the pubic yet.
