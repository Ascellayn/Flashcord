## Flashcord Alpha is releasing publicly extremely soon.
[Available for Repluged](https://replugged.dev/install?identifier=SiriusBYT/flashcord&source=github) Clients, BetterDiscord support will come later as it causes issue with certain things as it injects extra classes which somehow interfere with Flashcord.

# Flashcord is all about Maximising your Chat Space.

## üîÑÔ∏è Flashcord Version Status
ü¶∫ Flashcord Stable: [aSTB-230714 ] | **0 Updates Behind Flashcord SID.** | üåê Root Code Base: aSID-230714

üî• Flashcord SID: [aSID-230713] | **2 Days without an Emergency Hotfix Update.**

## üí° Instructions and Tips
‚ÑπÔ∏è It is not recommended to use Flashcord on Low-End Systems, you could, but in that case, disable animations, transitions and especially blur with the variables provided.

Flashcord recommends using **Discord Canary** as it was made on it.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Flashcord requires the "Channel Emojis" Discord Experiment for the best experience.
Flashcord can work without this experiment, however without it, Flashcord looks more dead and less full of life, it is very recommended to enable that experiment.

### üõë NOTICE ABOUT CUSTOM IMAGE BACKGROUNDS: Requires "LegalDiscordBypass" or Discord Nitro
Due to the complexity of Flashcord, it is better to seperate the Custom Background Image Theme into another one, problem is that the only other "it just works" theme is a Discord Nitro theme. 
Using the plugin [LegalDiscordBypasses by @loneweeb.tsx](https://replugged.dev/install?identifier=dev.tharki.LegalDiscordBypasses) is thus necessary if you wanna use said feature without Nitro.

Choosing any of those themes will activate the Custom IMG mode. It is recommended to use a dark themed one for visibility reasons.

### üéâ Flashcord Chat Effects

Adding any of these URLs at the end of your Discord message will add a special effect to your message. This is an experimental feature that is currently being rolled out to only certain people or places.
```
Rainbow Text Effect: http://flashcord/rainbow
Small Text Effect: http://flashcord/small
Shake Effect: http://flashcord/shake
```

## üî• Switching from Stable to Flashcord SID
Flashcord SID is the very much unstable version of Flashcord. **Unlike Flashcord Stable, who's getting updates every week, SID gets updated every night** on average around 21:30 UTC+01.

‚ö†Ô∏è You cannot decide if you wanna update or not with Flashcord SID, it updates as soon as your client fetches for Flashcord's code.
### It is SERIOUSLY NOT recommended to switch to SID. The Closed Alpha testers can tell you that when aSID-230703 came out, everyone died in pain and agony.
To switch to Flashcord SID, please **Paste the Following Line** into your **Quick CSS** and then click on **"Apply Changes"**
```
Instructions are currently not available as Flashcord isn't out yet.
```
To force update Flashcord SID, open the **DevTools** (CTRL + SHIFT + I), head over to the **Network** Tab, then check **"Disable Cache"** and click on **"Apply Changes"**.

‚ÑπÔ∏è Make sure to also not have Flashcord Stable still enabled after switching to SID to prevent code conflicts.
