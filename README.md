## Flashcord Alpha will release PUBLICLY on the 14th of July 2023!
### Invite Access now Available to all Members of the [SGN Discord Server](https://discord.gg/z93kHwGuZt).
[Available for Repluged](https://replugged.dev/install?identifier=SiriusBYT/flashcord&source=github), BetterDiscord support will come later as it causes issue with certain things as it injects extra classes which somehow interfere with Flashcord.

# Flashcord is all about Maximising your Chat Space,

## üí° Instructions and Tips
‚ÑπÔ∏è Flashcord is **NOT OUT YET!** These instructions are set in place in advance for future Flashcord users or for Closed Alpha Testers.

It is not recommended to use Flashcord on Low-End Systems, you could, but in that case, disable animations and transitions with the variables provides.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Flashcord requires the "Channel Emojis" Discord Experiment for the best experience.
Flashcord can work without this experiment, however without it, Flashcord looks more dead and less full of life, it is very recommended to enable that experiment.

### üõë NOTICE ABOUT CUSTOM IMAGE BACKGROUNDS: Requires "LegalDiscordBypass" or Discord Nitro
Due to the complexity of Flashcord, it is better to seperate the Custom Background Image Theme into another one, problem is that the only other "it just works" theme is a Discord Nitro theme. 
Using the plugin [LegalDiscordBypasses by @loneweeb.tsx](https://replugged.dev/install?identifier=dev.tharki.LegalDiscordBypasses) is thus necessary if you wanna use said feature without Nitro.

Choosing any of those themes will activate the Custom IMG mode. It is recommended to use a dark themed one for visibility reasons.


### üîÅ User Variables
The following variables can be changed to improve your Flashcord Experience.
```
:root, body {
  /* Control the Transition Speed of Elements. Set to 0 to Disable.*/
  --AnimMult-Fast: 1;
  --AnimMult-Normal: 1;
  --AnimMult-Slow: 1;

  --Enable-Animations: 1; /* Self Explanatory, set to 0 to Disable */

  /* Custom Background Customisation */
  --CustomBGR-IMG: url("https://sirio-network.com/flashcord/bgr-test.jpg");
  --CustomBGR-Filter: blur(16px) brightness(0.5);

  --Friend-Redesign: flex; /* If you are having severe issues in the friends tab because you have too many friends, set this to block */
}
```
