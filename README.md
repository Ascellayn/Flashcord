# This is Flashcord. The most advanced Discord Theme to date.

## Flashcord Alpha will release PUBLICLY on the 14th of July 2023!
### Invite Access now Available to all Members of the [SGN Discord Server](https://discord.gg/z93kHwGuZt).
[Available for Repluged](https://replugged.dev/install?identifier=SiriusBYT/flashcord&source=github), BetterDiscord support will come later as it causes issue with certain things as it injects extra classes which somehow interfere with Flashcord.

# Flashcord is all about Maximising your Chat Space,

# While also being the pinacle of Customisable Eye Candy.

## Instructions and Tips
ℹ️ Flashcord is **NOT OUT YET!** These instructions are set in place in advance for future Flashcord users or for Closed Alpha Testers.

### ⚠️ Flashcord requires the "Channel Emojis" Discord Experiment for the best experience.
Flashcord can work without this experiment, however without it, Flashcord looks more dead and less full of life, it is very recommended to enable that experiment.

### User Variables
The following variables can be changed to improve your Flashcord Experience.
```
:root, body {
  /* Control the Transition Speed of Elements. Set to 0 to Disable.*/
  --AnimMult-Fast: 1;
  --AnimMult-Normal: 1;
  --AnimMult-Slow: 1;

  /* Curstom Background Customisation */
  --CustomBGR-IMG: url("https://sirio-network.com/flashcord/bgr-test.jpg");
  --CustomBGR-Filter: blur(16px) brightness(0.5);
}
```
