--- Creator's Notes:
I'm pretty lean and chill when it comes to licensing, just give me a message on Discord and I'd probably let you ignore the licensing bullshit. (As long as you don't gain money off of it.)
I'll probably leave a part on either this Github's ReadMe or my Website that you got rights to do whatever you would have asked me.
